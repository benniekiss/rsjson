## Linting and Formatting

Make sure to run `cargo fmt`, `cargo check`, and `cargo clippy` prior to any

[`busted`](https://github.com/lunarmodules/busted). The tests can be run with
`lx test`

Rust unit tests can be run with `cargo test`.

## Building

To build the project as a lua module, run `lx build`, or `cargo build
--no-default-features --features module,lua{version}`, where `{version}` is one
of `55`, `54`, `53`, `52`, or `51`.

To build it as a library, run `cargo build`.

## Docs

Documentation is generated with
[`sphinx`](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) using the
[`sphinx-lua-ls`](https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/lua-ls/) extension.

To generate the docs, [install
uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and run `uvx
